    <p>This tool  enriches your point or area data by getting facts about the people, places, and businesses that surround your data locations.  
        <b>Enrich Layer</b> enables you to answer new questions about locations that you cannot answer with maps alone. For example: What kind of people live here? What do people like to do in this area? What are their habits and lifestyles? What kind of businesses are there in this area?
    </p>
    <p>The result will be a new layer containing  all demographic and geographic information from  given data collections.  This new information is added as fields in the table.
    </p>
    <p>If 
        <b>Use current map extent</b> is checked, only the features in the analysis and area layer visible within the current map extent will be analyzed.  If unchecked, all features in both the analysis layer and the area layer will be analyzed, even if they are outside the current map extent.

For the United States, Canada, and various other countries around the world, you can enrich your data  by adding various data collections with preassembled lists of attributes that provide demographic information and geographic context about the people, places, and businesses that surround your data locations.
